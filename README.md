# Code Test By Johan Valbuena 2024

Hi there, i developed this web page using Next.js as part of a test. The project consists of two modules. In the first module, the title and five cards are displayed, which are populated from a mock JSON file and rendered on the page. In the second module, there is a collage and text section where both the images and text are sourced from a second mock JSON file. This second module simulates a real service with a delay displaying a loading screen until the content is fully loaded, it only shows once since it saves the data, if you navigate and return to the page i will charge faster.

Both modules are fully responsive and have some cool animations, hope you like it.
